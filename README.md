# AlphaSignal AI News

This project is built around a simple idea: centralizing the AI-related news I receive almost daily from the AlphaSignal newsletter.

The plan is to scrape and organize that information into a structured, searchable index. Why? Because too often I find myself trying to recall a resource, tutorial, or article I know I've seen in an email. Thanks to the very powerful search bar of my mail app, I always spend a lot of time finding it (or not).

This README will evolve as the project takes shape and as I figure out what's actually realistic for me to build ðŸ˜‰.
