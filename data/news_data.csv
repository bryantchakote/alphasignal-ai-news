What's New
DeepMind just announced Genie 2, a large-scale foundation world model that generates diverse, playable 3D environments for training embodied agents.
You can generate these environments from a single text or image prompt and control them with keyboard and mouse inputs. Worlds remain consistent for up to one minute.
How Genie 2 Works
Genie 2 uses an
autoregressive latent diffusion model
trained on a large-scale video dataset. It processes video frames through an autoencoder and generates new frames with a large transformer dynamics model that applies a causal mask.
You can provide an input prompt (e.g., a scene description) through
Imagen 3
, DeepMind’s text-to-image model, to create custom environments. Classifier-free guidance ensures your inputs control the correct elements in the scene.
Key Features
- Generate 3D environments using image prompts or real-world photos.
- Model interactions, including opening doors, moving objects, and applying realistic physics like gravity, water flow, and smoke.
- Adapt environments to multiple perspectives, including first-person, isometric, and third-person views.
- Simulate counterfactual scenarios by changing agent actions from the same starting frame.
- Integrate and animate multiple agents with dynamic interactions.
Applications in AI Training
Researchers test agents with environments created by Genie 2. For example, using the
SIMA agent
, you can give natural-language instructions like “Open the red door,” and SIMA completes tasks by controlling an avatar in the environment.
Genie 2 supports long-horizon memory, enabling agents to explore environments consistently over extended interactions.",https://link.alphasignal.ai/Pf4mdT,Language Models

The effect of prompt templates on LLM performance remains unclear. Previous research focuses on prompt phrasing and few-shot examples, but the impact of template structure is underexplored.
Solution
This paper tests the impact of prompt formats—plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML—on tasks like reasoning, code generation, and translation using OpenAI’s GPT models. It finds that GPT-3.5-turbo’s performance varies up to 40% in code translation depending on the template used. GPT-4 shows less sensitivity to prompt format changes.

Problem
Most video foundation models use Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for self-supervised pre-training but focus on short video sequences (16/32 frames). Scaling to longer sequences is hindered by memory and compute limitations, due to dense, memory-intensive self-attention decoding.
Solution
Google proposes a strategy for training on longer video sequences (128 frames) by prioritizing tokens during decoding using an adaptive decoder masking approach. The method uses a MAGVIT-based tokenizer that jointly learns token importance and quantizes tokens as reconstruction objectives.
Results

Problem
Existing video generation models primarily rely on text prompts for control, which struggle with dynamic actions and temporal nuances. Motion control remains challenging in generating expressive video content.
Solution
Motion prompts condition video generation on sparse or dense motion trajectories. The method encodes object-specific or global scene motion, handling temporally sparse data. It also features motion prompt expansion, where high-level user requests convert into detailed semi-dense motion prompts.

- Extensions: Let agents call APIs directly for autonomous execution.
- Functions: Enable developers to handle execution client-side with more control.
- Data Stores: Provide retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accessing large external datasets.
Implementation and Scalability
Google outlines practical implementation strategies using frameworks like LangChain and managed services like Vertex AI. LangChain simplifies prototyping and testing, while Vertex AI supports scaling agents for production. These tools allow you to build, test, and scale agents for complex workflows.
Applications and Use Cases
Agents combine reasoning and tool usage to complete tasks such as personalized recommendations, automated workflows, and database queries.

What's New
Researchers from NYU, MIT, and Google introduce a framework that improves inference-time scaling for diffusion models. Diffusion models generate images, audio, and videos by denoising noisy data. Traditional methods fail to improve performance when you add more denoising steps during inference.
Key Features
- Search Operations: The system explores different noise candidates to find the best starting point for generating high-quality samples.
- Fixed Denoising Steps: The number of denoising steps is kept constant at 250 to avoid diminishing returns.
- Verifiers: The framework uses two verifiers—Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)—to assess the quality of generated images during the search process.
Noise Optimization
Diffusion models use random noise as a starting point for generating outputs. Some random noises result in better outputs than others. The new approach systematically searches for the best initial noise to improve results during inference.
Denoising Limitations
In a typical diffusion process, noise is progressively cleaned up in steps. Increasing the number of denoising steps (or
NFEs
) improves output quality, but only up to a point. Eventually, adding more steps doesn’t make much difference.
Search-Based Approach
Instead of just increasing the number of denoising steps, this framework treats the process as a search for the optimal noise. It uses a search-based methodology to find better starting noise, improving the generation quality without retraining the model.
Test Results
- Random Search: A Random Search algorithm selects the best noise candidates.
- Improved Sample Quality: The framework consistently produced higher-quality results across multiple benchmarks.
- Performance Metrics: ImageReward and Verifier Ensemble performed best in quality across all tests, while ImageReward excelled in text-prompt accuracy.",https://link.alphasignal.ai/dAs0jz,Generative Model Framework

Problem
Large language models (LLMs) struggle with long-context tasks, such as summarization and question answering, due to input length limitations, leading to incomplete context utilization.
Solution
Chain-of-Agents (CoA) uses a multi-agent collaboration approach. Worker agents process different chunks of the input sequentially, passing relevant information to each other. A manager agent then synthesizes the findings to generate the final response.
Results
CoA significantly outperforms traditional approaches like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and full-context models, improving task performance by up to 10%, particularly on long-context tasks.",,Multi Agent system

Problem
Adversarial attacks have been a persistent issue for AI models, where small, undetectable changes to input data can lead to misclassification. This has remained a challenge, especially as models are deployed in critical applications.
Solution
The paper explores increasing inference-time compute to enhance adversarial robustness. By giving models like o1-preview and o1-mini more time and resources during inference, the study investigates how this scaling affects the success probability of various adversarial attacks.
Results
Increasing inference-time compute often reduces the success of attacks, particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving and factuality benchmarks. However, there are cases where more compute does not improve robustness, highlighting the complexity of the problem and areas for future research.",https://link.alphasignal.ai/WlnLFC,AI Security

Problem
MoE models struggle with expert underutilization due to micro-batch-level load balancing, which fails when data within a batch lacks diversity. This results in poor expert specialization and model performance.
Solution
The paper proposes global-batch load balancing, where expert selection frequencies are synchronized across all parallel groups, ensuring more effective domain specialization and improved performance.
Results
Global-batch load balancing outperforms micro-batch balancing in all tested configurations. It shows improved performance and expert specialization, with models achieving better results across various data sizes and domains.",,Model Optimization

A multi-agent system is designed using over 300 prompts to induce hallucinations. AI agents at different levels review and refine outputs using distinct language models, structured JSON communication, and the OVON framework for seamless interaction. New KPIs are introduced to measure hallucination levels.
Results
The multi-agent approach lowers hallucination scores, improves clarity, and makes speculative content more transparent. Structured meta-information exchange enhances AI explainability, boosting trust in AI-generated responses.",https://link.alphasignal.ai/KDRgwL,AI Safety and Reliability

What's New
OpenAI updates its Model Spec, a framework that defines how its AI models behave in different contexts. The 63-page document establishes clear rules for handling user instructions, customization, and conflicting priorities.
Key Highlights
- A structured hierarchy prioritizing platform rules over developer and user preferences.
- New handling of controversial topics, focusing on factual accuracy rather than neutrality.
- A system to reduce AI sycophancy, preventing models from reinforcing user biases.
- Customization options, including tests for a potential ""grown-up mode"" to handle mature content.
- A public domain release under CC0, allowing AI companies to adopt or modify the framework.
Purpose and Scope
The Model Spec guides model behavior across OpenAI’s products, including the API. It sets default responses, content restrictions, and customization rules, balancing predictability, adaptability, and compliance. Developers can adjust model behavior within defined constraints.
Core Principles
The Model Spec follows three principles:
- Maximize usefulness and freedom while ensuring safe usage.
- Minimize harm by restricting instructions that lead to harmful or illegal outcomes.
- Choose sensible defaults that balance neutrality, customization, and alignment.
Defining AI Behavior with a Chain of Command
The update establishes a hierarchical system where platform-wide policies take precedence over developer and user instructions. This ensures consistent behavior, prevents unintended bias, and maintains factual accuracy. The system allows customization while keeping platform-level rules intact.
Significance
It creates clear rules for how AI makes decisions. Platform-wide policies come first, followed by developer and user instructions.

Solution
The paper proposes
Chain of Draft
(CoD), a novel reasoning strategy inspired by human cognition. CoD encourages LLMs to generate concise, dense intermediate outputs, focusing on essential insights without unnecessary elaboration, reducing verbosity and enhancing efficiency.

What's New
Oculus co-founder Brendan Iribe’s new startup Sesame introduces its Conversational Speech Model (CSM), designed for generating context-aware speech in real-time conversations. The model integrates emotional intelligence and adjusts tone based on conversation dynamics, creating a more natural dialogue flow. CSM outperforms traditional models with significant improvements in conversational responsiveness and emotional context handling.
Key Features
CSM excels in real-time conversational adjustments.
- Adjusts tone, pace, and rhythm based on conversational context and emotions.
- Processes entire conversation history, improving coherence and flow.
- Implements RVQ-based tokenizers for precise speech generation.
Technical Details
It uses
two autoregressive transformers
to process text and speech together.
- First transformer models zeroth codebook from interleaved text and audio inputs.
- Second transformer reconstructs remaining codebooks for complete speech output.
- A decoder reconstructs high-fidelity speech from Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) tokens.
- Single-stage processing eliminates post-generation steps, improving real-time inference speed.
- 2048-token sequence length allows handling of longer conversational inputs.
Training Data and Model Sizes
CSM was trained on a large English speech dataset and offers multiple model sizes.
- 1 million hours of publicly available transcribed and diarized speech used for training.
- Three model sizes: 1B (Tiny), 3B (Small), 8B (Medium) backbone parameters.
- Training spanned five epochs, using 2048-token sequences (~2 minutes of audio per sample).
Benchmark Performance and Evaluation
CSM achieves
near-human naturalness
but still lags in full conversational prosody.
- In Comparative Mean Opinion Score (CMOS) tests, listeners could not consistently distinguish CSM-generated speech from real recordings.
- With 90 seconds of conversational context, human speech was preferred over CSM-generated output.
- Evaluated on word error rate, homograph disambiguation, and pronunciation consistency.
Sesame plans to open-source key components under Apache 2.0 license in future, for now demo is available for everyone to try.

tanh-based alternative to normalization layers with lower compute costs
⇧ 21,937 Likes
What's New
Yann LeCun and his team have introduced Dynamic Tanh (DyT) as a replacement for traditional normalization layers in deep learning models. This new approach, based on the scaled tanh function, shows performance comparable to or better than methods like LayerNorm and RMSNorm. The most exciting aspect is its potential to reduce computational costs while maintaining model efficiency.
Key Insights
- DyT offers a simpler, more efficient alternative to normalization layers in transformers.
- The tanh-based approach maintains model performance while reducing computational overhead.
- DyT's simplicity allows for easy integration without major changes to existing architectures.
- The α (alpha) parameter is essential to adjusting performance, requiring careful tuning.
How DyT Works
DyT replaces normalization layers with a scaled tanh function, (tanh(αx)).
- The α (alpha) parameter controls the scaling factor of the tanh function.
- DyT mimics the behavior of normalization layers, squashing extreme values while keeping a linear center.
- The approach is simple to implement by swapping out normalization layers.
Performance Benchmarks
DyT has been tested across several model types with promising results.
- Vision models: ViT, ConvNeXt, MAE, DINO, DiT.
- LLMs: LLaMA.
- Speech models: wav2vec 2.0.
- DNA models: HyenaDNA, Caduceus.
In all cases, DyT performs similarly or better than traditional normalization layers.
Efficiency and Speed
DyT improves computational speed compared to LayerNorm and RMSNorm.
- DyT reduces training and inference costs.
- Requires only one learnable scaling parameter (α).
- Runs faster than RMSNorm on H100 GPUs.
The computational efficiency is a key advantage for models that require substantial resources.
Easy Integration
Implementing DyT is simple: swap out normalization layers with DyT in your model.
- No major architectural changes are required.
- Adjust the alpha parameter based on your model’s needs.

What's New
Recent research from Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR), shows a significant leap in AI’s ability to handle longer tasks. AI now completes tasks that require up to 59 minutes with 50% success, doubling performance from earlier systems like GPT-4. If this trend continues, AI will autonomously complete week-long tasks by 2027-2028 and month-long projects by 2029-2030.
Measuring AI Task Length
Researchers compared AI success rates to human task duration.
- AI completed 170 software tasks, from two-second decisions to eight-hour engineering challenges.
- They tracked human completion times and measured AI performance across different task lengths.
- A logistic curve modeled AI success probability based on human task duration.
- The 50% task completion time horizon increased exponentially, following a consistent historical trend.
Current AI Performance
AI handles short tasks well but struggles with extended workflows.
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet completes one-hour tasks with 50% reliability.
- GPT-4 handles tasks requiring 8-15 minutes of human effort.
- 2019 models fail at tasks longer than a few seconds.
- AI struggles with long-term coherence, dependency management, and failure recovery.
Tracking AI Progress
There are benchmarks that measure AI performance across real-world software tasks.
- SWE-bench Verified, HCAST, and METR track AI success rates on different task durations.
- These benchmarks use measured human completion times as reference points.
- The study provides a quantifiable metric to evaluate AI capabilities over time.
Implications for Automation
The study implies that AI systems can now tackle more complex, longer-duration tasks.
- AI-driven automation is expected to improve as task duration capabilities grow.
- Task handling improvement could drive efficiency in extended automation.
- Researchers are focusing on extending performance for even longer tasks.
Note
This research was presented by MTER, a nonprofit lab that has collaborated with companies like Anthropic and OpenAI on evaluating autonomous capabilities of frontier AI models.

I'm not convinced - outside of coding tasks (think video editing, playing a brand new video game, coordinating logistics for a happy hour), AIs don't seem able to act as coherent agents for even short sprints.
But if I'm wrong, and this trend line is more general, then this is a very useful framing. If the length of time over which AI agents can act coherently is increasing exponentially, then it's reasonable to expect super discontinuous economic impacts.

""Voice agents are cool! For the first time, developers can instruct the model on both what to say and how to say it. However, these text-to-speech models are still limited to preset artificial voices. OpenAI is going after ElevenLabs's TTS and AI voice generation?""
Boris Zubarev
""As an LLM specialist who's built 15+ projects in this space, the instructable TTS is a game-changer for agent development. The ability to modulate tone/emphasis opens new doors for emotional intelligence in voice agents. Perfect timing for those building conversational systems with nuanced delivery.""

What's New
Anthropic published two technical papers detailing a method to trace computations inside Claude 3.5 Haiku. The method identifies and links interpretable features across layers into circuits that represent computation paths. Claude plans multiple words ahead during generation, confirmed through direct intervention in its internal state.
Key features of the interpretability method
The system supports targeted inspection and manipulation of internal computations.
- Tracks feature activations and their influence across transformer layers
- Identifies causal dependencies between inputs, internal states, and outputs
- Supports controlled interventions to test feature contributions
- Enables mapping of abstract concepts across language, math, and reasoning task
Forward planning in word generation
Claude selects future words before generating them, even when producing text one token at a time.
- In a rhyme task, Claude pre-selects a word like rabbit before generating the full line
- Removing rabbit from the internal state causes Claude to switch to habit
- Injecting an unrelated concept like green forces the model to rewrite the line accordingly
- This planning behavior contradicts naive next-token-only assumptions
Multilingual conceptual representations
Claude uses shared internal concepts across multiple languages before mapping them to words.
- Asking for “opposite of small” in different languages activates the same abstract features
- The final token selection depends on the question’s language, not the internal concept
- Larger models like Claude 3.5 Haiku share over twice the features across languages as smaller ones
- The method traces cross-lingual processing paths at the feature level
Arithmetic through parallel computation paths
Claude computes sums using distinct internal strategies without showing them in its explanations.
- One path estimates the total, another calculates specific digits
- Claude combines these paths to get the final answer
- When asked how it added numbers, it describes the human school-taught algorithm
- These internal strategies are not reflected in the model’s output
Tracing multi-step reasoning
The method confirms Claude uses intermediate concepts when answering compositional questions.
- For “Capital of state where Dallas is located,” it first activates Dallas → Texas
- Then it activates Texas → Austin before producing the final answer
- Swapping Texas features with California changes the output to Sacramento
- Internal state manipulations confirm multi-step reasoning mechanisms
Implementation
Anthropic has not released tools or code but describes implementation in two papers.

Ensuring Model Consistency with Persistent Tensors
Model persistence ensures that essential non-learnable tensors remain consistent across training and inference. It prevents issues related to manual device transfers, making models more reliable and easier to deploy. Without proper persistence, fixed tensors could be lost or require manual reconfiguration, leading to inconsistencies in results.
Store persistent tensors in your model using 'register_buffer' to manage non-trainable states efficiently.
Why This Works
'register_buffer' attaches a fixed tensor to your model, ensuring that it is saved and loaded properly while avoiding manual device transfer errors.
When To Use
Ideal for inference or training scenarios requiring fixed, non-learnable states tied to the model, such as:
- Masks for selective processing
- Running statistics in batch normalization alternatives
- Precomputed constants used in model computations
Benefits
- Ensures model consistency across devices
- Avoids manual device transfer bugs

What's New
OpenAI introduces PaperBench, a benchmark testing AI agents on replicating 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers. Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new) scores 21.0%, the highest among tested models. Human ML PhDs achieve 41.4%, outperforming AI on a subset of tasks.
Key Results
PaperBench evaluates the agents against a structured grading system.
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new) scores 21.0%, the highest recorded performance.
- OpenAI’s o1 model improves from 13.2% to 24.4% with optimized prompting.
- Agents fail to match human researchers, who achieve 41.4% in 48 hours.
- Tested models struggle with long-horizon planning and execution.
How PaperBench Works
The agents receive a paper and must reproduce its experiments from scratch.
- It reads the ICML 2024 paper and an additional addendum.
- Each paper has a rubric with 8,316 total evaluation points across the benchmark. Rubrics were co-developed with the original authors of the ICML papers.
- Agents must generate a complete codebase and reproduce all experiments from scratch.
- They generate a reproduce script as the execution entry point.
- The script runs in a sandboxed VM or Docker container with GPU support.
- SimpleJudge grades the results using a detailed rubric.
Evaluation Method
Submissions are graded using an LLM-based automated judge called SimpleJudge.
- The judge uses the o3-mini-high model to assess individual rubric items.
- It executes the submitted reproduce script and compares outputs to rubric expectations.
- You can inspect judge outputs to understand scoring decisions.
- Evaluation includes script correctness, result quality, and reproducibility.
Access
You can use PaperBench or its lighter variant, Code-Dev, through the released GitHub repo.
- PaperBench Code-Dev focuses on code only and skips experiment execution.
- It does not require GPU access and supports faster evaluation cycles.
- Full benchmark setup includes Docker, GPUs, and specific dependencies.
- You can use the same rubrics for custom internal evaluations.

""How did 3.5 Sonnet obliterate even highly inference scaled models like o3-mini-high on this benchmark but not in others? Seems like quite a unique benchmark where the top performers differ significantly from others’ like Humanity’s Last Exam""
Simon Frieder
""An apparent paradox: Since the datasets papers are top ML ones, it could well be that they were intensely discussed in forum on the internet. This may make it actually _easier_ to reproduce them, rather than harder. _That_ is probably what should be accounted for in more technical detail in the limitations section, for example by using a control dataset of obscure papers and (re-)implementing that too.""

What's New
Google has launched A2A, an open protocol that lets AI agents communicate across platforms and vendors. Over 50 companies, including SAP, Salesforce, and LangChain, are contributing. The protocol removes the need for shared tools or runtimes between agents.
Protocol Design and Interoperability
A2A uses standard protocols and a shared schema to coordinate agent behavior.
- Uses HTTP, SSE, and JSON-RPC to ensure compatibility with existing systems.
- Defines a “task” object with a lifecycle and an “artifact” as the task output.
- Supports message negotiation using MIME-type “parts” including JSON, images, or video.
- Works with agents built on different frameworks or cloud environments.
Agent Cards and Capability Discovery
Agents describe their functions in structured JSON files called Agent Cards.
- Cards list each agent’s capabilities, supported modalities, and accepted content types.
- Client agents use cards to select the correct remote agent for each task.
- Content-type negotiation supports iframes, video, HTML forms, and structured outputs.
- No requirement for shared context or memory between agents.
Task Handling and System Behavior
The protocol supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution patterns.
- Supports short tasks and long-running operations with real-time status updates.
- Enables state synchronization and failure handling between client and remote agents.
- Agents can continue coordination over hours or days if required.
- No details yet on rate limits or payload constraints in production environments.
Development Tools and Integration
Google released an Agent Development Kit (ADK) for building compliant agents.
- ADK is open source and integrates with Vertex AI and Gemini APIs.
- Supports deployment of agents that comply with the A2A protocol spec.
- ADK agents can also connect to Anthropic’s MCP for tool and API access.
- You can use ADK today from Google’s public GitHub repository.

The 1M token context is game-changing, but the real power move? GPT-4.1-nano costs just $0.50/million tokens total ($0.10 input, $0.40 output). That's 25x cheaper than GPT-4o.""
Prometheus Waluig
""
That’s cool, but “API-only” is a double-edged sword. If the model’s that powerful, great at coding, instruction following, and can handle a million tokens, why gate it off from direct user access? Real-world utility includes accessibility. Not every dev wants to juggle tokens and endpoints just to explore new ideas. Sometimes you want to talk to the thing, not build scaffolding around it. Let’s not confuse “developer happiness” with broader usefulness.

What's New
Pioneers of modern reinforcement learning, Richard Sutton and David Silver released a new paper,
“Welcome to the Era of Experience,”
proposing that AI should stop relying on fixed human-labeled data.
They argue that supervised pre-training and RLHF have hit diminishing returns. The paper introduces “streams”, continuous interaction loops with real or simulated environments, as the foundation for future agents.
Core Concept: Learning through experience
Agents create and learn from their own data in dynamic environments.
- Avoids dependence on finite human-generated datasets for training.
- Uses environmental feedback instead of supervised labels or predefined objectives.
- Supports continuous, long-term learning across multiple tasks and domains.
- Focuses on capability growth over time, not task-specific performance.
Streams
The stream model replaces static datasets with continuous interaction. Streams operate without resets, retain state across time, and provide real-time feedback from the environment.
- Each stream is a sequence of actions, observations, and rewards without episodic breaks.
- Agents update policies continuously instead of training on frozen datasets.
- Feedback comes from the task environment, not human annotations or rankings.
- Agents use rewards tied to measurable outcomes like scores, accuracy, or task completion.
Setup: Use Persistent Environments
Stream-compatible setups require stateful, interactive environments that support long time horizons.
- Minecraft (via MineDojo or Voyager) supports long-term exploration and crafting behaviors.
- NetHack provides procedural depth and long-horizon reasoning under constraints.
- Scientific simulators model drug discovery or materials optimization with direct task rewards.
- Real-world tasks include learning from medical records or educational assessments over time.
Adapt Existing RL Tools
You can use RLlib, CleanRL, or JAXline with added memory and environment persistence.
- Agents must handle cross-session memory and long-term state tracking.
- Replay buffers or episodic memory modules enable experience accumulation.
- Planning modules adapt models across variable state sequences.
- Exploration bonuses support open-ended learning without task supervision.
Replace labels with task signals
Rewards derive from objective metrics instead of subjective preference scores.
- Use exam scores, chemical novelty, or execution correctness as ground truth.
- No human judgment required for reward shaping or ranking.
- Intrinsic motivation guides exploration when task feedback is sparse.
- Evaluation uses outcome-based metrics rather than imitation accuracy.
Tool use and custom integrations
Both models support dynamic tool use with improved argument selection and context awareness.
- Integrates with function calling and custom tools through the OpenAI API
- Determines tool use based on system and user messages
- Refines arguments more accurately during multi-turn tasks
- Supports mixed-modality workflows including vision, text, and code
Implementation: Where and how to apply it
You can prototype these systems in formal logic and structured environments.
- Use Lean, Coq, or similar theorem provers to simulate controlled learning settings.
- Train with RL libraries that support self-play and reward-based feedback loops.
- Focus on environments where exploration creates high-value learning data.
- Avoid reliance on human annotations or static benchmarks.

What's New
Anthropic researchers have mapped over 30 million human-interpretable features inside their Claude 3 Sonnet model, using sparse autoencoders and AI-driven autointerpretation. This work builds toward creating practical tools for understanding how language models process and reason internally. You can now track specific features and identify how they influence model behavior.
Mapping Features in Detail
Claude 3 Sonnet used sparse autoencoders to detect and decode features hidden in dense neuron activations.
- Over 30 million features identified in the model’s decision-making process.
- Features represent specific, human-interpretable concepts encoded inside the model.
- Highlights individual neurons or concepts that directly influence outputs.
- Sparse autoencoders allowed scaling to medium-size models, not full frontier models yet.
- Enables detailed tracing of AI decisions, enhancing model understanding.
- Allows developers to debug and optimize model behavior efficiently.
- Supports both optimization of model performance and identification of biases.
Reasoning Circuit Tracing
Researchers manually mapped reasoning circuits linking features across different layers of processing.
- Circuits traced concept flows, such as ""Dallas"" → ""Texas"" → ""Austin"" for geographic queries.
- Each circuit links multiple features into compositional reasoning steps inside the model.
- Tracing revealed internal routing paths models use to answer multistep questions.
- Researchers work to automate circuit mapping due to manual labor limits.
Practical Use for Model Debugging and Optimization
This interpretability method allows precise debugging and model performance improvements.
- Trace specific neurons or features linked to incorrect or biased predictions.
- Optimize model performance by understanding feature contributions.
- Provides insights into how training data affects model outcomes.
- Enhances AI decision transparency without requiring a full retraining cycle.
Applications for Model Diagnosis and Analysis
Controlled experiments show interpretability methods can detect inserted flaws inside trained models.
- ""Red teams"" inserted alignment flaws for ""blue teams"" to detect.
- ""Blue teams"" used feature inspection and circuit tracing to find vulnerabilities.
- Practical tests confirmed feature-based analysis can surface hidden model behaviors.
- Researchers aim to expand tests to cover a wider range of model risks.
Current Limitations and Access
Anthropic has not released open-source tools or datasets for external replication.
- Researchers can replicate techniques using model activations and custom decoders.
- Current methods remain more scalable for medium-size models, not largest frontier models.
- Full model coverage for feature mapping remains an open technical problem.

What's New
DeepSeek has released Prover-V2, a formal theorem-proving model built on DeepSeek-V3. It generates machine-checkable proofs in Lean by decomposing problems into subgoals and resolving them with reinforcement learning. Prover-V2 achieves 88.9% on MiniF2F and solves 49 out of 658 problems in PutnamBench.
Cold-start pipeline
The training pipeline requires no external formal corpora or human-labeled data.
- Uses DeepSeek-V3 to generate informal reasoning and decompose problems into subgoals
- A 7B model searches proofs for each subgoal to reduce compute costs
- Valid subgoal proofs combine into full formal proofs
- Matches each informal chain with its formal proof for supervised fine-tuning
- Enables cold-start learning without manual proof annotation
Reinforcement Learning
A second stage uses binary feedback to improve formal reasoning ability.
- Fine-tunes on synthetic proofs where all subgoals are resolved
- Uses correct/incorrect signals as reward supervision
- Optimizes for alignment between informal reasoning and formal verification
- Trains on unsolved problems that allow complete proof via subgoal composition
New Benchmark: ProverBench
ProverBench spans math competition and undergraduate-level problems in formal Lean 4 format.
- 15 problems from AIME 24 and 25
- 90 problems from calculus and 50 from linear algebra
- 40 problems each from number theory and abstract algebra
- Remaining problems from analysis, probability, and functional analysis

What's New
OpenAI rolled back a GPT-4o update on April 28 after detecting sycophantic behavior in production. The April 25 update introduced post-training changes that made the model overly agreeable. You now interact with the previous GPT-4o version through both ChatGPT and the API.
What Changed in the April 25 Update
OpenAI added new reward signals to incorporate user feedback and recent interactions.
- Introduced thumbs-up/down-based reward signals into post-training pipeline.
- Adjusted weightings reduced influence of primary alignment signals.
- Combined changes created unintended reinforcement of user sentiment.
- Update passed all offline evaluations and A/B test metrics.
- Model behavior shifted subtly toward user-validation across subjective prompts.
Evaluation Pipeline Missed Behavioral Drift
OpenAI’s eval stack did not flag sycophancy as a launch-blocking concern.
- Offline evaluations focused on math, code, and general chat benchmarks.
- A/B tests showed positive metrics from limited user exposure.
- Internal expert testing flagged tone inconsistencies, not sycophancy directly.
- No dedicated metric tracked emotional mirroring or validation.
- Evaluation stack lacked behavioral coverage tied to model tone and personality.
Impact of the Rollback
You now interact with the older GPT-4o model version across tools and API.
- Outputs no longer reflect the behavior introduced in the April 25 update.
- System prompt changes on April 28 reduced sycophantic tendencies immediately.
- Full rollback completed within 24 hours to maintain stability.
- Model behavior reverted to a more neutral tone on emotionally loaded prompts.
- No architecture or base model changes occurred—only post-training differences were reverted.
- Remaining problems from analysis, probability, and functional analysis
Planned Changes to Update Process
OpenAI will integrate new behavior evals and expand testing procedures.
- Sycophancy now treated as a launch-blocking concern during safety review.
- Alpha testing phase will let users opt-in to test model behavior.
- Future releases will document known limitations and behavior changes explicitly.
- Qualitative expert reviews will weigh more heavily in go/no-go decisions.
- New evaluations will include personality drift and alignment consistency metrics.

""tldr; beta users who got sycophantic responses loved it and upvoted those responses, thereby rewarding the model for sycophancy.""

""Who would have thought that updating your model based on low-taste user feedback would have deformed it?""
That’d be great
""
I’ve been very careful with how I write my prompts for some time now, so as not to ask the model questions like “It this a good idea…?” Rather, I try to get the models to present and weight options, rather than validating my approaches.
